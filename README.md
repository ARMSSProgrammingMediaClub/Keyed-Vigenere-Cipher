# Keyed Vigenere Cipher
</body>
The Vigenere Cipher is a type of substitution cipher used for data encryption (think passwords, legal documents, financial records etc.), invented by Blaise De Vigenere in 1586<br />
The Cipher requires a key to encrypt the plaintext, which is then further encrypted through a 26 X 26 table, containing all the letters of the alphabet.<br />

<br />
This Vigenere Cipher differs slightly from the original Vigenere Cipher as this Vigenere Cipher supports a keyed alphabet.
